## Smart Contracts: Voting System

### This contract is implemented with Solidity.

As Solidity is a recently new programming language, and most important is mainly contract-oriented, apparently Github does not support it.
Solidity offers a lot of facilities for programming Smart Contracts, one can read more about it in [Solidity documentation page](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.20/).

For developing, and also debugging it, I recommend using [Remix IDE](http://remix.ethereum.org/), but many other ways of compiling a .sol file can be found in [this section of Solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.20/installing-solidity.html).
